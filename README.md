Today in Python, I learnt how to start visualizing dataset using Python and the pandas library. 

I saw how some basic plots can give me insight into data and guide my analysis.

I learned how to:
1. Get an overview of my datasetâ€™s distribution with a histogram.
2. Discover correlation with a scatter plot.
3. Analyze categories with bar plots and their ratios with pie plots.
4. Determine which plot is most suited to my current task.
